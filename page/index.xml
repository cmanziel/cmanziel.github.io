My focus has shifted from university to it from time to time in the past couple of years until i decided to give it a shot and try to be a programmer by trade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m curious about the low level aspects of how things work, that&amp;rsquo;s why i focused on OpenGL, C and C++ so far and tried to create as much as possible from scratch.
I consider myself a person capable of adapting to various contexts since i&amp;rsquo;ve done different types of jobs in the past, and very eager to learn, i always try to make time in the day to expand my knowlege about a topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like enjoying my free time practicing and watching sports or going on an hike. My main choices when it comes to entertainment are podcasts and stand-up comedy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://cmanziel.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cmanziel.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>

I started learning programming while still a student and my interest naturally drifted to it. My focus has shifted from university to it from time to time in the past couple of years until i decided to give it a shot and try to be a programmer by trade.

I'm curious about the low level aspects of how things work, that's why i focused on OpenGL, C and C++ so far and tried to create as much as possible from scratch.
I consider myself a person capable of adapting to various contexts since i've done different types of jobs in the past, and very eager to learn, i always try to make time in the day to expand my knowlege about a topic.

I like enjoying my free time practicing and watching sports or going on an hike. My main choices when it comes to entertainment are podcasts and stand-up comedy.
